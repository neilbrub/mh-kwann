### Dev Setup

ii. Ensure Android SDK is installed (install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) if necessary)<br />
iii. Run `flutter doctor` to check if dev environment is good (shouldn't need to worry about Android Studio or vscode checklist)<br />
iv. Connect device / emulator and run `flutter devices` to check if connection is good<br />
v. Execute `flutter run` and let it build - should open on phone / emulator and hot-reload any code changes.<br />
